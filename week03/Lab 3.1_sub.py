# Program to subtract an number from another

# input reads in the string so we need to convert it into an int
# so we perform mathematical operations

x = int (input ("Enter your first number: "))
y = int (input ("Enter your second number: "))

answer = x-y
print ("{} minus {} is {}) " .format(x, y, answer))
