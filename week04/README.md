1. Start with any positive integer . 

2. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
  1. If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. 
  2. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 
  3. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
